## The CA trust store location

The CA trust store as generated by `update-ca-certificates` is available at the following locations:

- As a single file (PEM bundle) in ```/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt```
- As an OpenSSL compatible certificate directory in `/etc/ssl/certs`

**Note**: It is important to have the .crt extension on the file, otherwise it will not be processed.

### Rename extention from pem to crt

```sh
$ mv myPKIROOTCA-G1.pem myPKIROOTCA-G1.crt
$ mv myPKISUBCA-G1.pem myPKISUBCA-G1.crt
```

```sh
$ sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates
$ sudo cp local-ca.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates
$ sudo update-ca-certificates
```
To install the certificate into Ubuntu CA trust store run

```sh
sudo update-ca-certificates
```

Once completed you will see the following :
```sh
Updating certificates in /etc/ssl/certs...
rehash: warning: skipping ca-certificates.crt,it does not contain exactly one certificate or CRL
2 added, 0 removed; done.
Running hooks in /etc/ca-certificates/update.d...
done.

```

The main ca cert store is in
```sh
$ cd /etc/ssl/certs
```
